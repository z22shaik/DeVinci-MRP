# Devinci MRP Optimization üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Overview
In this project, an optimization model is presented for the Material Requirement Planning (MRP) of Devinci Bikes production. Leveraging Gurobi and Python within a Jupyter notebook environment, this model enhances DeVinci Bikes' current production methodologies.

## Key Features
1. **Optimized MRP Model**: A refined model focused on resource efficiency and waste minimization.
2. **Gurobi Implementation**: Capitalizing on Gurobi's robust optimization capabilities.
3. **Jupyter Notebook Documentation**: Workflow and analysis visualized in the `Devinci MRP.ipynb` file for clarity and reproducibility.

## Repository Contents
- `Devinci MRP.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook containing the optimization model, data, and results.
- `MSCI434_S20_Team27_Report.pdf`: A comprehensive report detailing the project, methodologies, results, and insights.
